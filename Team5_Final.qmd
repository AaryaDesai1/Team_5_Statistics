### Exploring the Impact of Happiness Metrics, Socio-Economic Factors, and Mental Health Disorders on Depression and Quality of Life Across Continents \| Aarya Desai \| Jeremy Tan \| Cassie Kang \| Osama Ahmed

## Abstract

There is widespread research which looks into the factors that influence happiness and those that affect mental health. However, the motivation of the current research project was to gain a holistic view of world happiness and mental health, potentially identifying causality between them. Therefore, after accessing data from the World Happiness Report and a University of Oxford dataset regarding mental health, two research questions were put forth to better understand how happiness metrics may influence mental health and how mental health (and other quality of life metrics) may influence an overarching concept of happiness called Quality of Life (QoL):

1.  To what extent do happiness metrics and socioeconmic factors predict depression in continents?
2.  To what extent do mental health disorders, happiness metrics, and socioeconomic factors predict quality of life?

The results of this study revealed global patterns in depression predictors. Higher log GDP per capita and freedom to make life choices correlate positively with depression, while greater healthy life expectancy and lower perceptions of corruption are associated with lower depression rates. Generosity, positive affect, low social support, and negative affect impact depression. For the second part of this study, the results revealed higher percentages of the population having depression predicted "Bad Quality of Life," while economic prosperity and freedom to make life choices enhance the likelihood of "Good Quality of Life." Contrary to intuition, however, the results also revealed that higher percentages of eating disorder populations in a region predict "Good Quality of Life". Finally, geographically, the Americas and Oceania are linked to better quality of life, with Asia showing a moderate connection. Both models had high predictive power, and therefore, the results are reliable. However, this brings into question the result found regarding eating disorders and Good Quality of Life. This may be explained by the complex relationship between region, QoL, and individual factors/psychology that could lead to eating disorders. Such insights along with strengths, limitations, and future directions of the study are elaborated upon in further in the paper.

## Introduction

There is widespread research looking into how happy a country is based on certain socioeconomic and individual-level factors (Ahmadiani et al., 2022). Furthermore, there is also wide-ranging research looking into various mental health disorders and their impact on quality of life (Chigerwe et al., 2020). There is a general consensus that the better a countries' socioeconomic status, the higher they score on the happiness index (Ahmadiani et al., 2022). On the other hand, mental health disorders are suggested to be caused by a plethora of factors, such as, genetics, environmental circumstances, financial circumstances, etc. (Evans et al., 2006). The aim of the current research paper is to gain a better understanding of these two schools of research together, but look at it in a more general context (continent instead of country).

The prevalence of depression is on the rise across the globe (Bell & Blanchflower, 2019). Furthermore, research has indicated that this may have to do with one's socioeconomic status, where individuals with lower socioeconomic statuses are more likely to experience depressive symptoms (Graham & Pinto, 2019). Contrarily, research has also shown that happiness interventions have been shown to reduce depression among individuals (D'raven et a., 2014). Therefore, there is an established correlation between depression and happiness. The current research paper would like to extend these findings and try to establish a predictive inference of depression based on happiness metrics.

On the other hand, there could be a reverse relationship between these factors as well. To better explain this, it is important to understand the concept of Quality of Life (QoL), which refers to the overall well-being of an individual or population (Teoli & Bhardwaj, 2023). This includes having good personal health (mental, physical, and spiritual), strong relationships, good education and social status, healthy work environment, good income, sense of safety/security, freedom to make choices, and healthy physical environment. Based on this definition, the current study could look into how/to what extent mental health disorders and the other QoL metrics mentioned could predict QoL.

Based on the motivations of this current paper, two research questions were put forth to further investigate the schools of thought mentioned. For the same, the two datasets found for this study were the World Happiness Report (2022) and University of Oxford Mental Health Disorders Data (2022). The two research questions which will be answered in the following sections are:

1.  To what extent do happiness metrics and socio-econmic factors predict depression in continents?
2.  To what extent do mental health disorders, happiness metrics, and socio-economic factors predict quality of life?

Both of these research questions will be approached as prediction problems. This will provide more room to understand the predictive potential of key metrics and gaining insight into the extent to which they serve as indicators of depression and QoL. Employing a prediction approach will offer valuable insight into future possibilities of informed interventions and policy decisions to address mental health and well-being on a broader scale.

## Methods

### Data

***Merging Data:*** The datasets selected were merged on common countries and years, and then a larger dataset with 1462 observations was created. It contained 18 variables (9 happiness metrics, 7 mental health disorder variables): Country, Year, Life Ladder, log GDP per capita, Social Support, Life expectancy at birth, Freedom to make life choices, Perception of corruption, Generosity, Positive affect, Negative affect, Alcohol use disorders (%), Drug use disorders (%), Schizophrenia (%), Bipolar disorders (%), Anxiety Disorders (%), Eating Disorders (%), and Depression (%).

***Dataset Information:*** The happiness metrics were a range of factual data collected from census surveys (e.g., Log GDP per capita, life expectancy at birth) and self-reported variables collected from the population of each country in a given year (e.g., life ladder, freedom to make choices, social support, etc). The final variables of this dataset were also self-reported measures of positive and negative emotions which were culminated and calculated into the variables positive affect and negative affect (required to analyze happiness reports for countries). The mental disorders dataset's variables indicated the percentage of the population that had the stated mental disorder in the given country and year per observation.

***Data Cleaning and Manipulation:*** First, the 153 countries were grouped into their respective continents, as our primary interest lies in discerning variations in our research questions across different continents. Another transformation was done in relation to the second research question to predict one's Quality of Life (QoL) mental health and happiness metrics. This was done with the help of the variable Life Ladder in the World Happiness dataset, originally derived from a metric called the Cantril ladder, which asks respondents to rate their current lives on a scale of 0 (worst possible life) to 10 (best possible life). In the World Happiness dataset, this variable was an average of all the results collected from citizens of the specific country in the given year (i.e., a float, continuous variable). To simplify the same, an overarching binary variable indicating "Lifestyle Category", i.e., Good Quality of Life (Good QoL) vs. Bad Quality of Life (Bad QoL), was created. This was done using the midpoint of the Life Ladder scale (i.e., 5.5) and then recoding a Lifestyle Category variable to Bad QoL if the observation was below the midpoint and Good QoL if it was above.

***Dealing with Missing Data***: Before conducting EDA for either research question, there was an exploratory analysis of solely the NA values in the dataset to understand how to deal with them. Overall, the NA values (*n* = 217, total observations with NA values = 144) seemed to be very randomly distributed across the dataset, and across different variables (namely, Log GDP per capita, Social support, Freedom to make life choices, Generosity, Positive affect, and negative effect). However, perceptions of corruption NA values (*n* = 87) was missing in very specific patterns, where only certain countries were missing the data (namely, China, Jordan, Malta, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan and United Arab Emirates) barring some randomly distributed NAs across other observations. As noticeable, there is a pattern in missingness which must be addressed. For the same, for those countries which has some observations for any missing variables across the years, the mean values from across the years were imputed into the missing observations (done for all variables). For China and Turkmenistan that did not have *any* data for perceptions of corruption, data was imputed based on research done regarding the politically most similar countries to each of these (Jones, 2023). Based on the research, it was found that Taiwan, Vietnam, North Korea, South Korea, and Japan were the most similar to China while Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan are the most similar to Turkmenistan. Thus, values were imputed by calculating means across each year for the available countries most similar to China and Turkmenistan respectively.

        mean(Turkmenistan_similar_data[[col]], na.rm = TRUE)
    }
  }
}
```

### Models

***Models Chosen***: Both research questions were approached as **prediction problems** and we proceeded with examining the question as such. Since we are predicting depression % for those in their respective continents, we use linear regression to build a model. For the second research question, since we are predicting QoL (a binary variable), we use logistic regression to build a model. After finalizing our models, we made test data to predict on our model to validate our model.

***Variables and Interaction Terms**:* *A priori* selection of variables was conducted for both models based on pre-exisiting literature discussed in the introduction. For RQ1 focus on predictor variables: Log GDP per capita, Social Support, Life expectancy at birth, Freedom to make life choices, Generosity, Perceptions of Corruption, Positive affect, Negative affect, Continent, and Year. Notably, we intentionally avoided incorporating overlapping variables from other distinct research inquiries (namely, life ladder), ensuring a tailored exploration into the predictive relationship between these factors and depression. Finally, there is research which suggests that generosity and social support are highly interconnected, as prosocial and supportive environments/peers are likely to elicit positive and giving behavior from individuals (Chen et al., 2021; d'Exelle & Riedl, 2010). Therefore, an interaction term of Generosity and Social Support was also included in this prediction model.

For RQ2, our focus is on predictor variables: Schizophrenia (%), Bipolar Disorder (%), Eating disorders (%), Anxiety disorders (%), Drug use disorders (%), Depression (%), Alcohol use disorders (%), Log GDP per capita, Social support, and Freedom to make life choices. It is important to note that research has suggested that a lack of social support is most likely to increase the risk of substance abuse (Cherry, 2023; Eddie et al., 2019; Horigian et al., 2020). Therefore, it is likely that there is an interaction between the predictors social support and alcohol abuse. For the same, an interaction terms were included in this logistic regression model (i.e., Alcohol Use and Social Support) to be in line with current psychological and addictive behaviors literature.

### Model Assessment

***Model Fit Checks***: After building the initial benchmark models, the significance of the variables was assessed using p-values, multicollinearity was checked using VIF scores, and the accuracy was checked via cross validation to see if our model predicts well.

***Influential Points***: To improve model accuracy and reliability, high leverage points were systematically identified and removed. Leveraged values and studentized residuals were calculated, where points with leverage values greater than 2 \* (number of coefficients) / (number of observations) were identified as high leverage points. After identifying the high leverage points, they were removed from the dataset, and the model was refitted.

***Model Accuracy Checks***: FOR RQ1, accuracy was measured using RMSE. For RQ2, the ROC curve was checked to see the best threshold needed for our model to predict accurately. Then, a confusion matrix was made for the final model to assess it with F1, Kappa, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.

Table 1 provides an overview of the continuous variables used in this regression. As a part of the EDA, a correlation analysis matrix, a matrix scatterplot to assess the relationship between the outcome variable and all the predictor variables and a histogram to further understand the distribution of the outcome variable were plotted (see Appendix A). **From this analysis, it was**

***Initial Model Assessment:***

Checking for high leverage points revealed 47 observations as being influential. These were removed from further analysis and model was refit without them. After refitting the model, to mitigate high multicollinearity issues, where elevated VIF values (\>10) were observed, certain variables were excluded to ensure stable standard errors and improve model interpretability. Specifically, Generosity (74.038) and the interaction term Generosity and Social Support (74.609) were removed to streamline the model.

***Regression Findings:***

The baseline level of depression, with all predictors at reference levels, was estimated at 3.5010. A notable finding was the significant variation in depression rates across continents. Being in the Americas, Asia, or Europe was associated with decreases in depression rates by 0.6915, 0.5719, and 0.4929 percentage points, respectively. Conversely, Oceania demonstrated a marginal increase in depression rates by approximately 0.03 percentage points. The coefficients for individual years from 2006 to 2017 did not show statistical significance, indicating a stable trend in depression rates over these years.

Economic and health indicators revealed complex relationships with depression rates. An increase in Log GDP per capita was associated with a rise in depression percentages by 0.2588 units, suggesting that higher economic wealth might not be protective against mental health challenges. In contrast, Healthy Life Expectancy at Birth showed a negative correlation with depression (coefficient = -0.0211), highlighting the importance of physical health in mental well-being.

Social and psychological factors also demonstrated significant associations with depression rates. Freedom to Make Life Choices (coefficient = 0.3260) and Generosity (coefficient = 0.2759) both positively correlated with depression rates, possibly indicating underlying societal pressures. Additionally, the category of Low Social Support was positively associated with depression (coefficient = 0.1276). Perceptions of Corruption negatively affected depression rates (coefficient = -0.5918), underlining the role of societal trust in mental health.

Emotional states, as indicated by Positive and Negative Affect, showed contrasting impacts on depression. While Positive Affect was marginally negatively associated with depression (coefficient = -0.4765), Negative Affect displayed a strong positive association (coefficient = 0.7913), emphasizing the influence of emotional states on mental health. Notably, the interaction term between Generosity and Low Social Support did not present statistical significance (coefficient = -0.2026, p-value = 0.5128), suggesting that the combined effect on depression rates was not as pronounced as their individual effects. The statistical significance of these predictors is mostly robust, with p-values indicating high significance (p\<0.05) for most coefficients, excepting the coefficients for continent Oceania, Years, Positive affect and the interaction between Generosity and Low social support.

***Model Fit and Diagnostics***

Regarding model fit and diagnostics, the Residual Standard Error was 0.5709, and the R-squared value of 0.2496 indicated that approximately 24.96% of the variability in depression rates was captured by the model. The F-statistic of 17.19, along with its associated low p-value, confirmed the model's statistical significance.

In conclusion, the study highlighted the multifaceted nature of factors influencing depression rates, including economic, social, health, and emotional aspects. The results emphasize the need for holistic mental health policies and interventions that integrate these diverse factors. The study also pointed out geographical variations in depression rates, with lower rates observed in the Americas, Asia, and Europe compared to Oceania.

***Findings:***

All findings for the logistic regression were found in the form of log-odds. Therefore, these coefficients were exponentiated and converted to percentage increases in the likelihood of experiencing Good QoL with each unit increase in the predictor variable.

An increase in the percentage of anxiety slightly decreased the likelihood if having a Good QoL by approximately 26.48%. Notably, contrary to intuition, eating disorders significantly influenced the likelihood of having Good QoL, showing an approximately 251.85% increase in the likelihood. Similarly, alcohol use disorders and drug use disorders, emerged as significant predictors, increasing the likelihood of Good QoL by about 42.98% and 107.18% respectively.

Economic and social factors demonstrated considerable influence, with 'Log GDP per capita' and 'Freedom to make life choices' showing significant positive effects. A unit increase in Log GDP per capita corresponds to roughly a 63.48% increase in the likelihood of having Good QoL, while an increase in 'Freedom to make life choices' corresponds to approximately a 715.61% increase in the likelihood. Finally, the geographical analysis indicated that being in the Americas significantly increased the likelihood of having Good QoL by roughly 203.92%, while effects in other continents such as Asia, Europe, and Oceania were not significant.

Depression, schizophrenia, and years were not found to significantly predict the Good QoL.

The model provides valuable insights into predicting either "Good Quality of Life (QoL)" or "Bad QoL." Notably, higher percentages of depression and eating disorders are associated with a predicted "Bad QoL," while economic prosperity (measured by log GDP per capita) and the freedom to make life choices contribute to a higher likelihood of "Good QoL." Geographically, being in the Americas or Oceania is linked to a better quality of life, with Asia showing a moderate connection to improved QoL. Surprisingly, alcohol use disorders increase the likelihood of "Good QoL," while drug use disorders also have a substantial impact. Mental health factors, such as schizophrenia and anxiety disorders, strongly influence what is considered a "Good Quality of Life." These findings underscore the complex nature of "Quality of Life," where various factors, including disorders, have a complex relationship with each other.

***Model Fit and Diagnostics***

The logistic regression model demonstrates a high accuracy of 89.88% in distinguishing between 'Good QoL' and 'Bad QoL,' significantly surpassing the No Information Rate of 53.97%. The confusion matrix for the logistic regression model indicates a strong predictive performance, correctly identifying 572 instances of 'Good QoL' and 707 instances of 'Bad QoL'. There were 61 cases where 'Bad QoL' was mistakenly classified as 'Good QoL', and 83 instances where 'Good QoL' was misclassified as 'Bad QoL'. The accuracy is supported by a 95% confidence interval ranging from 88.2% to 91.4%, indicating a high level of confidence in the model's predictive capabilities. The Kappa statistic of 0.7958 suggests a strong agreement between the model's predictions and the actual outcomes. The model's sensitivity, or its ability to correctly identify 'Good QoL' cases, is at 87.33%, while its specificity, or the ability to correctly identify 'Bad QoL' cases, stands at 92.06%. This indicates that the model is more adept at predicting 'Bad QoL' accurately. The Positive Predictive Value (or precision) and Negative Predictive Value are also high, at 90.36% and 89.49%, respectively, demonstrating the model's reliability in its predictions. With a F1 score of 88.82%, the model achieves a balanced harmonic mean of precision and recall, which confirms its robustness.

The ROC curve further corroborated these findings, with an AUC of 0.959 signifying a commendable model performance in differentiating outcomes. The point "0.521(0.921, 0.876)" suggests an optimal balance between sensitivity (87.33%)) and specificity (92.06%). Overall, the model demonstrates that the logistic regression model has a high capability for correctly classifying individuals into the correct QoL category.

## Conclusion

When analyzing both models, we are confident that both models can accurately predict both quality of life and depression within different continents after examining RMSE, and a combination of F1, Kappa, and Accuracy for the respective models. We feel, however, that we need more data for some continents (such as Oceania) and more years to further enhance both our models.

Analyzing depression levels across continents provides interesting insights. Higher wealth (Log GDP per capita) surprisingly corresponds to increased depression, challenging expectations. Longer life expectancy is linked to lower depression, while more freedom is unexpectedly tied to higher depression. Lower corruption perceptions are associated with better mental health. Generosity is unexpectedly linked to increased depression. Positive feelings are connected to lower depression, and the importance of supportive communities is clear, with low social support linked to higher depression. Negative feelings predictably contribute to increased depression.

In conclusion, the logistic regression analysis reveals key determinants of "Quality of Life" (QoL), distinguishing between "Good QoL" and "Bad QoL." Higher rates of depression and eating disorders are linked to "Bad QoL," while economic prosperity (measured by log GDP per capita) and the freedom to make life choices tend to predict a "Good QoL." Geographically, living in the Americas or Oceania is associated with better QoL, with Asia showing a moderate positive link. The model intriguingly suggests that alcohol use disorders may correlate with "Good QoL," a finding that needs further exploration. Additionally, drug use disorders and mental health conditions like schizophrenia and anxiety disorders significantly influence the assessment of QoL. These results highlight the complex and varied factors contributing to life quality.
